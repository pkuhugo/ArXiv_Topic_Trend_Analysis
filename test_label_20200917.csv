communication networks, occur naturally in various real-world applications.
Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and
different patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to
perform the analysis. Recently, methods which use the representation of graph
nodes in vector space have gained traction from the research community. In this
survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph
embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first introduce the
embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of
dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We
then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods,
random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in
each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate
these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their
performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some
potential applications and future directions. We finally present the
open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods,

small adversarial perturbations that are nearly imperceptible to human. Such
specially crafted perturbations cause deep learning systems to output incorrect
decisions, with potentially disastrous consequences. These vulnerabilities
hinder the deployment of deep learning systems where safety or security is

  In this paper, we propose MagNet, a framework for defending neural network
classifiers against adversarial examples. MagNet does not modify the protected

Different from previous work, MagNet learns to differentiate between normal and

does not rely on any process for generating adversarial examples, it has
substantial generalization power. Moreover, MagNet reconstructs adversarial
examples by moving them towards the manifold, which is effective for helping
classify adversarial examples with small perturbation correctly. We discuss the
intrinsic difficulty in defending against whitebox attack and propose a
mechanism to defend against graybox attack. Inspired by the use of randomness

In this paper, we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy when training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this result, we adopt a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple techniques, our Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192 on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using commodity hardware, our implementation achieves ~90% scaling efficiency when moving from 8 to 256 GPUs. Our findings enable training visual recognition models on internet-scale data with high efficiency.",Image ,,Learning,Aspects of DL,Faster,,,

tasks, including but not limited to image classification, text mining, and
speech processing. However, recent research on DNNs has indicated
ever-increasing concern on the robustness to adversarial examples, especially
for security-critical tasks such as traffic sign identification for autonomous
driving. Studies have unveiled the vulnerability of a well-trained DNN by
demonstrating the ability of generating barely noticeable (to both human and
machines) adversarial images that lead to misclassification. Furthermore,
researchers have shown that these adversarial images are highly transferable by
simply training and attacking a substitute model built upon the target model,
known as a black-box attack to DNNs.
  Similar to the setting of training substitute models, in this paper we
propose an effective black-box attack that also only has access to the input

different from leveraging attack transferability from substitute models, we
propose zeroth order optimization (ZOO) based attacks to directly estimate the
gradients of the targeted DNN for generating adversarial examples. We use
zeroth order stochastic coordinate descent along with dimension reduction,
hierarchical attack and importance sampling techniques to efficiently attack
black-box models. By exploiting zeroth order optimization, improved attacks to
the targeted DNN can be accomplished, sparing the need for training substitute
models and avoiding the loss in attack transferability. Experimental results on
MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the proposed ZOO attack is as effective

learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on
user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information
about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent
years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph
structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep
learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual
review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs,

where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for
generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution
(DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can
fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results
show that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and
16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least
one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence
on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10
dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial
machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are
also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an
important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in
the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively
generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating
robustness.

  Fairness","Added new experimental results and a slightly modified fairness
  definition",,,,cs.LG cs.DS cs.GT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The most prevalent notions of fairness in machine learning are statistical
definitions: they fix a small collection of pre-defined groups, and then ask
for parity of some statistic of the classifier across these groups. Constraints
of this form are susceptible to intentional or inadvertent ""fairness
gerrymandering"", in which a classifier appears to be fair on each individual
group, but badly violates the fairness constraint on one or more structured
subgroups defined over the protected attributes. We propose instead to demand
statistical notions of fairness across exponentially (or infinitely) many
subgroups, defined by a structured class of functions over the protected
attributes. This interpolates between statistical definitions of fairness and
recently proposed individual notions of fairness, but raises several
computational challenges. It is no longer clear how to audit a fixed classifier
to see if it satisfies such a strong definition of fairness. We prove that the
computational problem of auditing subgroup fairness for both equality of false
positive rates and statistical parity is equivalent to the problem of weak
agnostic learning, which means it is computationally hard in the worst case,
even for simple structured subclasses.
  We then derive two algorithms that provably converge to the best fair
classifier, given access to oracles which can solve the agnostic learning
problem. The algorithms are based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as a
two-player zero-sum game between a Learner and an Auditor. Our first algorithm
provably converges in a polynomial number of steps. Our second algorithm enjoys
only provably asymptotic convergence, but has the merit of simplicity and
faster per-step computation. We implement the simpler algorithm using linear
regression as a heuristic oracle, and show that we can effectively both audit
and learn fair classifiers on real datasets.

gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution
strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and
policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems.
However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs
stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference
approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether
non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we
demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple,
gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on
hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA
successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the
largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm.
These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2)
suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best
choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the
multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate
the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages
exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a
high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.\ DQN, A3C,
ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN

We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPALA for multi-task reinforcement learning on DMLab-30 (a set of 30 tasks from the DeepMind Lab environment (Beattie et al., 2016)) and Atari-57 (all available Atari games in Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013a)). Our results show that IMPALA is able to achieve better performance than previous agents with less data, and crucially exhibits positive transfer between tasks as a result of its multi-task approach.",Games,,Reinforcement Learning,,Better accuracy,,,

learning, yet the fundamental reasons for this success defy mathematical
understanding. Learning a neural network requires to optimize a non-convex
high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem which is usually attacked
using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum
of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the first case, does this happen
because local minima are absent, or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the
second, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties?
  In this paper we consider a simple case, namely two-layers neural networks,
and prove that -in a suitable scaling limit- SGD dynamics is captured by a
certain non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call

Learning a neural network requires to optimize a non-convex high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem which is usually attacked using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the first case, does this happen because local minima are absent, or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the second, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties?   In this paper we consider a simple case, namely two-layers neural networks, and prove that -in a suitable scaling limit- SGD dynamics is captured by a certain non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call distributional dynamics (DD).

we train students parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly,
these {Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly,
both on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs

Commonly, the teacher is a high-capacity model with formidable performance, while the student is more compact. By transferring knowledge, one hopes to benefit from the student's compactness. %we desire a compact model with performance close to the teacher's. We study KD from a new perspective: rather than compressing models, we train students parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly, these {Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly, both on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs based on DenseNets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 (3.5%) and CIFAR-100 (15.5%) datasets, by validation error. Additional experiments explore two distillation objectives: (i) Confidence-Weighted by Teacher Max (CWTM) and (ii) Dark Knowledge with Permuted Predictions (DKPP). Both methods elucidate the essential components of KD, demonstrating a role of the teacher outputs on both predicted and non-predicted classes. We present experiments with students of various capacities, focusing on the under-explored case where students overpower teachers. Our experiments show significant advantages from transferring knowledge between DenseNets and ResNets in either direction.",Image ,,Distillation,,Better accuracy,,,

  mappings of word embeddings",ACL 2018,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recent work has managed to learn cross-lingual word embeddings without
parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space through
adversarial training. However, their evaluation has focused on favorable
conditions, using comparable corpora or closely-related languages, and we show
that they often fail in more realistic scenarios. This work proposes an
alternative approach based on a fully unsupervised initialization that
explicitly exploits the structural similarity of the embeddings, and a robust
self-learning algorithm that iteratively improves this solution. Our method
succeeds in all tested scenarios and obtains the best published results in
standard datasets, even surpassing previous supervised systems. Our
implementation is released as an open source project at

and styles. This method is based on a multi-domain wavenet autoencoder, with a
shared encoder and a disentangled latent space that is trained end-to-end on
waveforms. Employing a diverse training dataset and large net capacity, the
domain-independent encoder allows us to translate even from musical domains
that were not seen during training. The method is unsupervised and does not
rely on supervision in the form of matched samples between domains or musical
transcriptions. We evaluate our method on NSynth, as well as on a dataset
collected from professional musicians, and achieve convincing translations,
even when translating from whistling, potentially enabling the creation of
instrumental music by untrained humans.
